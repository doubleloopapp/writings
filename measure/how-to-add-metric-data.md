# How to add metric data

By adding your metric data into DoubleLoop, you can see stats on your strategy map and metrics graphs for your workstreams.

## Add data points manually

Sometimes it's easiest to enter data by hand. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on a metric in the strategy map or from the metric page.
2. Click "Create data point."
3. Enter the value and date.
4. Click "Save."

## Tool integration

1. DoubleLoop has native integration with [Looker](https://looker.com/). Learn about it [here](looker-integration.md).
2. We integrate with Google Analytics via [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). Check out the [DoubleLoop/GA Zapier template](https://zapier.com/webintent/create-zap?template=600472) (requires signing into Zapier).

## We'll do it for you!

DoubleLoop is new and we have lots of integrations to add. For that reason, we're offering a paid service where we'll import your metrics into DoubleLoop for you. Additionally, we'll keep on them to let you know if we see exceptions or anomolies that you might be interested in.
