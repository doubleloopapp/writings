# How to add metric data

By adding your metric data into DoubleLoop, you can see stats on your strategy map and metrics graphs for your workstreams.

## Import data from your analytics tools

DoubleLoop allows you to import time series data from your analytics tools like Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Looker. See our full list of "[measure integrations](https://doubleloop.app/integration-category/measure)".

To connect a metric to a data source, follow these steps:

1. Double-click a metric on your strategy map or click the "i" icon for a metric.
2. Click on the "Source" tab in the right drawer.
3. Follow the steps to connect the source.

Reach out to us if you have questions! This gif illustrates:

## CSV upload

Learn about it [here](upload-metrics-via-a-csv-file.md).

## Add random dummy data!

Before you connect your metrics in DoubleLoop to data sources, you can populate your map with random dummy data so you can see and share what a data-integrated map will look like.

Here's a demo:

## Add data points manually

Sometimes it's easiest to enter data by hand. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on a metric in the strategy map or from the metric page.
2. Click "Create data point."
3. Enter the value and date.
4. Click "Save."
