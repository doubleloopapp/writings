# Google Sheets integration

Our Google Sheets integration is a great way to quickly populate your stategy maps without the data. Even if you're planning to ultimately connect DoubleLoop directly to your metric sources, the Google Sheets integration can be a great way to make a proof-of-concept of a data-connected maps.

## Video overview

This video provides a high-level overview of how the Google Sheets integration works:

## Example

Here's an example of a Google Sheet populated with data that you can import into DoubleLoop:

## Connecting Google Sheets to DoubleLoop

1. Go the [Metrics listing page](https://app.doubleloop.app/metrics).
2. Click the "..." in the upper right and click "Connect to Google Sheets"
3. Follow the authorization steps.
4. Click the "..." and click "Open Linked Data sheets"

## Importing data from Google Sheets into DoubleLoop

1. The top of your linked Google Sheet has detailed instructions for how to use the integration (see example above).
2. After you've updated data in your Google Sheet, you can import the data into DoubleLoop by clicking "Import latest data" on the [Metrics listing page](https://app.doubleloop.app/metrics).&#x20;

Notes:

* You can use the Google Sheet integration to update existing metrics in DoubleLoop or add new metrics. See the instructions at the top of the linked Google Sheet. To add a metric to the map that you added via Google Sheets, after clicking the "Metric" option a map, you can search to find that metric.
* The Google Sheets integration is not a bi-directional sync. If you make changes in DoubleLoop and would like the Google Sheet to reflect that, you can unlink your linked Google Sheet and re-connect. This will export the latest data to a linked Google Sheet.
