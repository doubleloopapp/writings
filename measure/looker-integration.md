2.  In Looker, go to the "Actions" screen in the admin section.

## How to send metrics from Looker to DoubleLoop

1. Find the Looker Look that contains the metrics you’d like to provide to DoubleLoop. **It must contain at least one date and metric value.**
2.  From the configuration menu, choose the \`Schedule...\` option.

3.  Give your Schedule a name, pick how often you’d like it to send (we suggest daily), and hit \`Send Test\` followed by \`Save All.\`

4\. After that you will see the metric appear in your [metrics list](https://app.doubleloop.app/metrics). To see it on your strategy map, set the "Show on strategy map" toggle to the ON position.
