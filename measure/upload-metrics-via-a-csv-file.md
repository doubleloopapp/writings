# Upload metrics via a CSV file

## How it works

Start by downloading this Excel file:

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/Example Metrics CSV Upload File (1).xlsx" %}

1. Fill out the spreadsheet with a row for each metric, date, and value. You can do many metrics in one file.
2. Share the spreadsheet with your contact at DoubleLoop team or email support@doubleloop.app.
3. We'll let you know when the upload is complete. All of the metrics will be available to see as line graphs in DoubleLoop.
4. We're happy to upload and re-upload as frequently as you'd like to update your metrics data.

Apologies that this CSV upload feature isn't self-serve yet! If we see sufficient demand for this feature, we'll add a serve-serve option.
