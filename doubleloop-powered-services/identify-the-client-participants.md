# Identify the client participants

Here are the folks the client will want consider including in creating a value architecture for an initiative:

* Initiative lead (e.g., product manager)
* Initiative stakeholders (e.g., the lead’s manager or other interested parties)
* Initiative team members (e.g., engineers, designers, marketers who are working on the initiative)

Typically you’ll want to include 3-10 participants.

| **Participants**  | <p></p><ul><li>Consultant</li><li>Client lead</li><li>Initiative lead</li></ul> |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sync or async** | <ul><li>Either</li></ul>                                                        |
| **Outcome**       | <ul><li>A list of participants, including their roles and emails</li></ul>      |
