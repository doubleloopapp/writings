# Selecting a first initiative for a proof-of-concept

When selecting an initiative for your first proof-of-concept, consider this criteria:

* Initiative is high-priority
* Initiative is active; i.e., iterations have already been deployed, bets have been made
* Team has decision-making power
* There is executive interest in the DoubleLoop process

| **Sync or async** | <ul><li>Either</li></ul>                                                                        |
| **Outcome**       | <ul><li>Youâ€™ve identified an initiative with the client for a first proof-of-concept.</li></ul> |
