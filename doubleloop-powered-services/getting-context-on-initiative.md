# Getting context on initiative

Request the following info from your client's initiative lead:

* Description of their companyâ€™s business model
* For the selected initiative, a list of 3-5 recent launches, iterations, or experiments
* For each of those items, ask the client for:
  * the hypothesis/goal behind the launch
  * the history of events/changes related to the initiative (e.g., when specific features or campaigns went live, or when experiments started/ended)
