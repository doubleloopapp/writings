#### Description of the Business Model

Kohl's digital sales business model is built around attracting traffic to our online platform and converting visitors into customers. Traffic comes from various channels, including direct visits, organic search, referrals, and paid advertising. The model operates by focusing on the efficiency of converting visits into purchases and the amount of revenue generated per visitor.

#### Description of the Customer Journey

The customer journey on our digital platform begins with visitors arriving through multiple channels.
