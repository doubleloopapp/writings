# DoubleLoop GitHub app setup

Here's how to get started:

1. Go here: [https://metaloop.app/](https://metaloop.app/)
2. Now you can create your account. You can either...
   1. Click the "create an account" link, or
   2. Click the button to sign up with GitHub.
3. After creating your account, you'll be asked to name your organization. Enter the name of your company and click "Create organization."
4. Now let's connect your GitHub. Click the gear "Settings" icon in the left nav.
5. Click "Integrations."
6. Now click "Install GitHub App" and walk through the steps. If you're concerned about granting access to GitHub, please check out our [security page](https://www.doubleloop.app/security) for context.
7. When you're done, you won't get a confirmation message. But if you go back to the integrations page, you'll see your GitHub integration like this:

That's it! Now, your product iterations will flow into DoubleLoop with each PR or commit. After the data populates for a few days, you can [learn how to set up filtered Slack notifications](https://app.gitbook.com/@doubleloop/s/doubleloop/~/drafts/-MSjRHp3FpfVn0Dd7IS1/instructions/slack-setup).
