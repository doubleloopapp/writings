# Our Jira app

## Overview

Jira is designed to help you get work done. It's not designed to help you track previous launches or communicate wins to stakeholders. That's what DoubleLoop is for. You can use DoubleLoop to create a [source-of-truth for your product iterations](../use-cases/a-system-of-record-for-product-iterations.md), quantify the impact of your product initiatives, and create [filtered views](filtering-and-saving-views.md) of product updates tailored for different audiences.

### How to install the Jira app

1. If you haven't already, [create your DoubleLoop account](https://app.doubleloop.app/sign_up).
2. After you're logged in, navigate to the Integration pages by clicking "Integrations" in the left rail.
3. Click the "Install Jira app" button and walk through the steps.
4. Now you need to add our webhook. Under your list of "Installed Integrations" at the bottom of the integrations page, click the "Setup" button in the Jira row. Copy your webhook to your clipboard.
5. Login to Jira. Add the webhook to your Jira account by going to the "Webhooks" page in System Settings.
6. When you create the webhook, select the "created," "updated," and "deleted" checkboxes under "Issue" shown here:

## Ok, we installed it. Now what?

DoubleLoop doesn't import historical data yet, but after you change the status of an issue or create a new issue,  you'll see it appear on the [all events](https://app.doubleloop.app/events) page in DoubleLoop. After you have some data, try filtering by epic, label, team member, and/or issue status to [create some awesome views](filtering-and-saving-views.md).

## We're here to help

After you set up our Jira integration, let us help you get started. [Schedule an onboarding session](https://calendly.com/doubleloop/onboarding?back=1&month=2021-04) and we can configure some powerful views together to create your ideal workflow. If you'd like, we'll teach you how to add your metrics to quantify the impact of your product initiatives.
