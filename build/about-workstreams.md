# About workstreams

## Overview

Your "workstreams" are collections of work activities. For example, your workstreams might contain your product iterations or your marketing experiments. You can organize them by initiative, project, epic, or team.

On this page, you'll learn why you should track your workstreams in DoubleLoop and how to populate them with live data from your tools like Jira.

## Why should your record your workstreams in DoubleLoop?

On your [strategy map](../strategy-map/strategy-map-concepts.md), you can illustrate how your workstreams are intended to impact your metrics. However, the power of DoubleLoop is unleashed when you populate each workstream with the history of what has been done in that workstream, your product launches, campaigns, etc..

When you populate your workstreams with data, DoubleLoop gives you an unprecedented ability to understand the impact of your activities and communicate efficiently with stakeholders.

### Understand the impact of your activities

On your workstreams page in DoubleLoop, you can view a history of all events in that workstream which is valuable by itself. However, you can also see your metrics overlayed on the same graph which is game-changing for understanding impact.

The above example is our "Marketing experiments" workstream that we use at DoubleLoop. The bar graph indicates how much activity happened each day. The line graph shows the related input metric "Marketing site visitors." When we see that a marketing impact led to a spike in the metric, we mark it with those green bars.

### Get a macro view of where your team is investing energy&#x20;

Product leaders oversee a portfolio of initiatives. By populating their workstreams with data, you can see where the team is spending energy, or not.

Our own strategy map for DoubleLoop is above. You can see from the [stats](../strategy-map/stats-on-your-strategy-map.md) that we have an initiative to add more "Building tool integrations" that's been inactive for the last six weeks.

### Keep stakeholders in the loop

DoubleLoop makes it efficient for stakeholders to follow along with what's happening in the workstreams they care about via a [Slack integration](../slack-setup.md), [email digests](../email-digests.md), or [release notes pages](../private-and-public-stakeholder-views.md).

## Workstream integrations

While you can record events in your workstreams manually, the best way to do it is through integrations with your tools. That way, you can keep your finger on the pulse of activity without any extra data entry.
