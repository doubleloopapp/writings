# About workstreams

## Overview

Your "workstreams" are collections of work activities. For example, your workstreams might contain your product iterations or your marketing experiments. You can organize them by initiative, project, epic, or team.

On this page, you'll learn why you should track your workstreams in DoubleLoop. To learn more on the mechanics of setting up workstreams, go [here](how-to-setup-workstreams.md).

## Why should your record your workstreams in DoubleLoop?

On your [strategy map](../strategy-map/strategy-map-concepts.md), you can illustrate how your workstreams are intended to impact your metrics. However, the power of DoubleLoop is unleashed when you populate each workstream with the history of what has been done in that workstream, your product launches, campaigns, etc..

When you populate your workstreams with data, DoubleLoop gives you an unprecedented ability to understand the impact of your activities and communicate efficiently with stakeholders.

### Understand the impact of your activities

For metrics in DoubleLoop, you can view a history of the events in the workstreams that influence that metric. The events are overlaid on the metric graph so you can explore what activities had an impact on the metric.

### Get a macro view of where your team is investing energy

Product leaders oversee a portfolio of initiatives. By populating their workstreams with data, you can see where the team is spending energy, or not.

Our own strategy map for DoubleLoop is above. You can see from the [stats](../strategy-map/stats-on-your-strategy-map.md) that we have the initiative to add more "Building tool integrations" that's been inactive for the last six weeks.

### Keep stakeholders in the loop

DoubleLoop makes it efficient for stakeholders to follow along with what's happening in the workstreams they care about via Slack integration, email digests, or [release notes pages](../private-and-public-stakeholder-views.md).
