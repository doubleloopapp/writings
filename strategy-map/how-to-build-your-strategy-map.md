# How to build your strategy map

## Connecting nodes & deleting connections

**To connect nodes**, put your cursor on the gray bar on the side of a node. Click to drag the connect and release it on the gray bar of the destination node. The gray bar will turn green when your cursor is in the right position.

**To delete connections**, click the connection and tap delete on your keyboard.



## Add metrics or workstreams to strategy maps

There are two ways to add metrics or workstreams to your map.

1. To add something new, click the "Add metric" or "Add workstream" button on the top of a strategy map.
2. To add an existing metric or workstream to your map, navigate to that item either on another strategy map or on the metrics or workstreams listing page and open its settings. From there, you can select the checkbox for the strategy you would like to add it to.

## Deleting nodes

There are two ways to delete nodes:

1. Click the node and click delete on your keyboad.
2. Double click the node and click the trash icon in the side drawer.

Note: if you click the trash icon, you have the option to remove the node from your strategy map without deleting it. This would allow you to use the metric later or in a different strategy map.
