# Stats on your strategy map

DoubleLoop is not your typical flowchart tool. DoubleLoop enables you to populate your map with data from your [metrics](broken-reference) and [workstreams](broken-reference). Seeing this data in the context of your strategy map will help you learn what's working and what's not so you can make necessary adjustments or pivots.

## How do you populate the stats?

Go here:

****[**How to add metric data**](../measure/how-to-add-metric-data.md)****

[**How to add workstream data**](../build/about-workstreams.md)****

## What stats display?

DoubleLoop displays statistics using the same time intervals used by Amazon in their regular review meetings. Data in the strategy map gives you a sense of short- and long-term change.

For each node, you see amounts for the last 7 days, the last 6 weeks, and the last 12 months. Under each stat, you see the percent change compared to the previous time period of that same length. So if you see "^ 50%" change for the last 7 days, it means that that your amount was 50% higher in the last 7 days compared to the seven days that appeared immediately before it.

The figure that displays for each time interval depends on the type of node:

* **Metrics with a type of "counts."** The sum of data points is displayed for each time interval.
* **Metrics with a type of "percentages."** The average percentage is displayed for each time interval.
* **Workstreams**. The total number of events is displayed for each time interval. This gives you a sense of which workstreams are bustling with activity or dormant.

## Notes

* The current day is not included in any of the stats.
* The stats currently update just once per night.
