# Customer advisory board

## Overview

So much work is wasted. Companies continually work on projects wth poor business impact while failing to double-down on initiatives with the highest ROI.

In part, it's a tools problem. Today's tools separate work from measuring business results, leading teams to focus on outputs, not outcomes. DoubleLoop's paradigm breaks these boundaries, bringing clarity to actions and results. We're on a mission to transform how teams learn and execute strategy.

Yet, a human problem persists: spreading new ways of working is difficult. To address this, we've formed the DoubleLoop customer advisory board, to bring together leaders who share our vision for outcomes-driven work. Members will play an important role in shaping the future of DoubleLoop and transforming how companies achieve business results.
