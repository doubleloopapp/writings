# Upload metrics via a CSV file

To automatically add your metric data to DoubleLoop, we have a [Looker integration](looker-integration.md) and a Google Analytics integration via [our Zapier app](https://zapier.com/apps/doubleloop/integrations).

Howevever, those integrations only work moving forward for new metrics data. They don't add your historical metrics to DoubleLoop yet. And many folks, of course, don't use Looker or Google Analytics.

Consequently, we created another way to get metrics into DoubleLoop: CSV upload.

## How it works

Start by downloading this Excel file:

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/Example Metrics CSV Upload File.xlsx" %}

1. Fill out the spreadsheet with a row for each metric, date, and value. You can do many metrics in one file.
2. Share the spreadsheet with the DoubleLoop team via Slack or email support@doubleloop.app.
3. We'll let you know when the upload is complete. All of the metrics will be available to see as line graphs in DoubleLoop.
4. We're happy to upload and re-upload as frequently as you'd like to update your metrics data.

Apologies that this CSV upload feature isn't self-serve yet! If we see sufficient demand for this feature, we'll add a serve-serve option.
