# Email digests

Email digests are a great way to keep stakeholders in the loop with product updates. DoubleLoop loop automatically generates email digests to make the process efficient. Here's an example of what one looks like:

## How it works

1. You can set up a separate email digest for each "view" you have in your DoubleLoop account. Go [here](filtering-and-saving-views.md) to learn more about views.
2. Every week, DoubleLoop will send out the email digest to a list of subscribers. The email will include all updates from the previous seven days.
3. The default send time of the email digest is Mondays at 9 A.M. However, you can change the day/time in the "Email" section of the view settings. See below.
4. Initially, nobody will be subscribed to the email, not even you. You can subscribe yourself or other email addresses in the "Add subscribers" field. See below.
5. Folks can also self-subscribe to the email digest by clicking the "Subscribe to updates" button on the [stakeholder view](private-and-public-stakeholder-views.md).
