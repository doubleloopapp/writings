## Cards (a.k.a. Flexible cards)

Use "Cards" to add any type of object you'd like to maps. You can customize the "types" of cards you add to match the vocabulary of your company.

Examples: Objectives, Customer Journey Steps, Pillars, Teams.

## Metrics

"Metrics" have time series data aggregated into stats. You can connect metrics to your data sources. Connect two metrics to see the correlation between them. You can attach key results to metrics if you'd like to set targets.

Examples: Monthly active users, ARR.

## Bets

"Bets" can be anything your company is investing in to achieve a business outcome. You can record hypotheses and results for bets.\
\
Examples: Improve song recommendation algorithm, launch new marketing campaign.

## Work

"Work" is similar to bets, but it's more intended for tactical execution. If you connect your work management tool, you can add (e.g.) Jira objects directly to your maps.

Examples: Implement AI model for song recommendations, back-end refactor.

## Sub-maps

If your map is getting too complex, you can nest maps inside maps. For example, you might have a company-wide map that shows how your products fit into the big picture of your strategy. Each product itself can be a map, with its on metrics.

Example: Marketing strategy, Checkout team strategy

## Sections

Use sections to logically organize your map. Add connectors to sections to avoid having to draw lots of connects to individual nodes.

## Notes

Add any text you want to provide context.

## Images

Add screenshots or any image you'd like.
