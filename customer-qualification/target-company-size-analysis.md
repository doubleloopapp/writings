# Target company size analysis

Deciding which company sizes to target is a key strategic question. Here's our current thinking.

1. Ultimately, we see DL growing revenue through large companies. The bigger the company, the more they have the pain points we solve. And, of course, they have big budgets. The exceptions are the whales \(FB, Amazon, Google\) who have homegrown systems tangled in their release process.
2. However, there are cons to focusing on bigger companies in the short term:
   * they have entrenched processes,
   * more gatekeeping/security around integrations, and
   * more people to convince.
3. Our current thinking is that, in the short term, **we should focus on the smallest companies that have the pain points that we solve**.
4. We have three reasons for this approach:
   * They have low friction for adding new tools/integrations.
   * The boundary between engineering and product is fluid. They're likely to have product-focused engineers and technical PMs. They may or may not have folks with the title "product engineer," but in practice, folks are performing this role. DL could even allow them to delay hiring PMs.
   * Pushing ourselves to make DL valuable for small teams will position us for a **freemium model** which is our best path for explosive growth. The freemium model is how I'd like to enter large companies. If a small company gets value from DL, small teams at big companies will get value. I'd like DL to spread organically bottom-up without an expensive sales process.

But this leaves open the question: what is the range of company sizes we should target in the short term? We're thinking **Series A** is the sweet spot. These companies are forced to think about scaling processes and communications, but they're not so big that they have bureaucracies around new tool adoption.
