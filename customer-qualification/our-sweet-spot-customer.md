# Our sweet spot customer

TLDR; we're looking for **engineers or PMs** at **Series A** companies who use **GitHub** to build **web apps**.

| Dimension | Sweet spot | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tools used | GitHub | Currently, our new platform requires GitHub integration. See our long term [integration vision](https://whimsical.com/6caUFmcYiyCDYvEshPHnzw). |
| Company size | Series A | Series A companies are starting to scale their product development operation, creating the perfect opening for new tool adoption. However, many bigger or smaller companies may be perfect for DoubleLoop. See our [target company size analysis](target-company-size-analysis.md). |
| Department | Engineering or Product management | DoubleLoop serves _product engineering_ teams. We can enter companies through product-focused engineers or technical PMs. |
| Function | Managers or Individual contributors | DoubleLoop spreads in companies either bottom-up or top-down. |
| Product | Web app | For now, DoubleLoop works best for teams building web apps. Mobile apps, desktop apps, or physical products are different animals. |
| Industry | Any | Companies in any industry can benefit from DoubleLoop, either B2B or B2C. |
