# Company Map Generator (AI assistant)

Note: this feature is only open to users in our beta group. To request access contact support@doubleloop.app.

## Overview

The purpose of our Company Map Generator is to enable companies to quickly map the strategy of their prospects or customers, or even their own strategy.

For example, based on a public investor presentation and off-the-shelf marketing materials, you can generate a map like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 09.49.32.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click <a href="https://app.doubleloop.app/strategy/4053/map">here</a> to see actual map in DoubleLoop.</p></figcaption></figure>



## Use cases

We've seen companies use this tool for combinations of these purposes:

* Sales teams generate maps of their prospects in the sales process.
* Customer success teams generate maps of their current customers to show how they deliver value.
* Product teams generate maps of their customers to inform their product strategy and roadmap.
* Product teams generate maps of their own company's strategy to illustrate how their work fits into the big picture.

## Instructions

### Setting the stage

1. Login at [https://app.doubleloop.app/](https://app.doubleloop.app/).
2. Click "Create map"
3. Use the "Corporate Objectives Template"
4. Wait for the map to fully populate on the canvas. It takes about 45 seconds. When done, you should see this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 11.57.40@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Corporate objectives template</p></figcaption></figure>

### Use the AI assistant to populate the template

#### Synthesize the strategy from available documents

1. Click the head icon in the bottom toolbar to open the AI assistant menu.![](<../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 11.59.24@2x.png>)
2. Select "Company map generator."
3. Click "Start a new conversation"
4. Type "Go" and submit the message. It will take a few seconds for the first message to process.
5. When prompted "What company are you focused on?", enter the name of the company you want to map the strategy for (e.g., Target) and submit.
6. When prompted "What materials should I use for the analysis?", upload PDFs, .txt documents by clicking the upload icon, or paste text directly into the message and submit. You must enter some text like "Here ya go" to submit the message. Notes/tips:
   1. The AI assistant can't access URLs, so you need to provide the content directly.
   2. For the content, we recommend PDFs of earning reports, earning presentation transcriptions, strategy decks, CEO interviews, company websites, or company release notes.
7. The AI assistant should give you a summary of what you provided to help you feel confident that it can analyze the content.
   1. If the descriptions of the content look suspiciously generic, ask it to try again to summarize or upload new files.
   2. If it looks good, tell it to "proceed."
8. Now the AI assistant will give you a text synthesis of the strategy. This allows you to adjust the strategy summary before you populate the map. You can adjust it however you want; e.g., by telling the AI to focus on a specific part of the strategy (e.g., "Focus on digital strategy") or go deeper into one area (e.g., "One of the objectives should be about AI"). When you're happy with it, tell it to "proceed."

9. Now we're ready to update the map... keep reading in the next section.

#### Update the map with the strategy

This section gets a little technical in running through the process of updating the map. In the future, we want to better hide "how the sausage is made."

10. The AI assistant should provide you with a list of all the "template spaces" from the map. There should be 89 of them and it should look like this: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 12.28.49@2x.png" alt="" data-size="line">
    1. If it doesn't look right, ask it to try again.
    2. If all looks good, say "Proceed"
11. Now the AI assistant will use the strategy you generated before to populate each template space on the map. It should look like this: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 12.34.43@2x.png" alt="" data-size="line">. You can probably just trust it and say "proceed". If something goes wrong down the road, you can come back to this step to figure out what happened.
12. Now the AI assistant will populate your map! After a bit of time, you should see the template disappear and a new map with the strategy content re-appear. Wait until you see all the connectors on the map appear (it might look like it gets stuck, but wait for it...)

#### Make adjustments

13. Remove any objectives, initiatives, or metrics that you want. Sometimes you will see "Not needed" or a metric that you think is goofy. <img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 12.40.24@2x.png" alt="" data-size="line">
14. Make any other changes you want; e.g.:
    1. Rename nodes
    2. Add new stuff
    3. Do whatever you want to the map!

Note: if you think the map is too far off from anything you want to use, it's probably best to start this entire process over. In the future, we want to make it easier to use the AI assistant to tweak the map after it's been generated.

#### Share the map

15. If you want to populate the map with dummy data to simulate what it will look like with real data, click the gear icon in the upper right to open "strategy settings." In that modal, click "Populate metrics random data." After you submit the subsequent form, your metrics will start "lighting up" with dummy data.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 12.56.32@2x (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Map lit up with dummy data</p></figcaption></figure>

15. Also in the "Strategy settings" modal, you can change the sharing settings to "Public." Be sure to click "Save" at the bottom of the modal after you do. Then you can share a link to the map.
    1. Note: if you want to share a version of your map with no dummy data, add `?metricData=false` to the end of the URL like this: [https://app.doubleloop.app/strategy/4385/map?metricData=false](https://app.doubleloop.app/strategy/4385/map?metricData=false). When you're in this mode, you can light up the map with data by clicking "show metric data" in the toolbar.<img src="../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-08-21 at 12.54.24@2x.png" alt="" data-size="line">
16. Of course, the best way to share the map is probably over a screen share in a meeting with your team or customer. Edit the map together! It's just a jumping-off point.

## How you can take this further

1. Map your value proposition to the map (see the screenshot at the very top).
2. Map "bets" to the map.
3. Create sub-maps to go deeper into certain areas.
4. Work with the DoubleLoop to customize this process to your specific value pop and customer profile.
