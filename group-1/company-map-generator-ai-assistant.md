# Company Map Generator (AI assistant)

Note: this feature is only open to beta users. To request access contact support@doubleloop.app.

## Overview

The purpose of our Company Map Generator is to enable companies to quickly map the strategy of their prospects or customers, or even their own strategy.

For example, based on a public investor presentation and off-the-shelf marketing materials, you can generate a map like this:

## Use cases

We've seen companies use this tool for combinations of these purposes:

* Sales teams generate maps of their prospects in the sales process.
* Customer success teams generate maps of their current customers to show how you deliver value to them.
* Product teams generate maps of their customers to inform their product strategy and roadmap.
* Product teams generate maps of their own company's strategy to illustrate how their work fits into the big picture.
