# How to create and share changelogs

There are many reasons to use [workstreams](../build/about-workstreams.md) in DoubleLoop. You can use DoubleLoop to share changelogs or release notes internally with stakeholders or publicly with customers or investors. For example, check out our public changelog [here](https://app.doubleloop.app/changelogs/impact-log).

To see and share a changelog, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a workstream, either from your map or from the workstream listings page.
2. Click "Settings" to adjust your [privacy settings](../private-and-public-stakeholder-views.md) as you see fit.
3. Click the "Share" button.

Combined with our integrations with Jira, Shortcut, and Linear, DoubleLoop supports a very efficient workflow for making changelogs. This video shows how we maintain our changelog at DoubleLoop:
