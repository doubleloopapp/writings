# How to create and share changelogs

There are many reasons to use [workstreams](../build/about-workstreams.md) in DoubleLoop. You can use DoubleLoop to share changelogs or release notes internally with stakeholders or publicly with customers or investors. For example, check out our public changelog [here](https://app.doubleloop.app/changelogs/impact-log).

## Why create changelogs?

Changelogs are a great way to keep stakeholders or customers in the loop with your progress. Teams who create changelogs earn confidence from their organization.

## How to create changelogs

To see and share a changelog, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a workstream, either from your map or from the workstream listings page.
2. Click "Settings" to adjust your [privacy settings](../private-and-public-stakeholder-views.md) as you see fit.
3. Click the "Share" button.

## How the content is organizaed

On the changelog, events are grouped by week. Events with "Major" and "Medium" importance are at the top of the email with images and descriptions. "Minor" are listed at the bottom.

## Demo video of how we maintain our changelog at DoubleLoop

Combined with our integrations with Jira, Shortcut, and Linear, DoubleLoop supports a very efficient workflow for making changelogs. This video shows how we maintain our changelog at DoubleLoop:
