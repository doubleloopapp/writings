# Slack integration

DoubleLoop makes it easy to manually or automatically push information to Slack. Using our Slack integration helps teams stay aligned and up-to-speed with progress.

## How to integrate Slack

Start by connecting our [Slack integration](https://app.doubleloop.app/settings/integrations/slack) from the integrations page. Then setup the types of messages you'd like as described below.

## Types of Slack messages sent from DoubleLoop

| Type                    | Why use it?                                                                   | How to do it?                                                                                                                                     |

| Weekly strategy review  | Keep your team in-the-loop with performance of key metrics and intiatiatives. | Open the "settings" for a map and enter a Slack channel. You'll then get a weekly message summarizing the performance of metrics and workstreams. |
| Metric subscription     | Keep a team or project focused on the performance of a single key metric.     | In metric settings, enable the Slack digest. Choose a Slack channel and configure the schedule/frequency.                                         |
| Workstream subscription | Get automated updates as soon as work is finished.                            | In workstreams settings, add a channel. As soon as new items appear in that workstream, a message will be sent to that channel.                   |
| Manually share events   | Share progress with stakeholders when the time is right.                      | Click the share button next to an event for a workstream. Then choose the channel to send the event to.                                           |
