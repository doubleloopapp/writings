# Email digests

DoubleLoop allows you to automatically generate weekly email digests that summarize the activity in a [workstream](../build/about-workstreams.md).

## Why send an email digest?

Changelogs are a great way to keep stakeholders or customers in the loop with your progress. Teams who create changelogs earn confidence from their organization. Email digests provide an easy way to deliver the information without requiring folks to regularly check your changelog.&#x20;

## How to set it up

1. In the settings for a workstream, click the toggle to "Enable email digest."
2. Choose when you would like the email to be sent and how frequently.
3. Save your settings.

## How the content is compiled

DoubleLoop will generate the email digest by compiling events in the workstream from the last 7 days before the start date. Events with "Major" and "Medium" importance will be at the top of the email with images and descriptions. "Minor" events will be listed on the bottom.

## How to add subscribers

Users can either self-subscribe via the [changelog](how-to-create-and-share-changelogs.md) page (see [example](https://app.doubleloop.app/changelogs/impact-log)) or you can manually add subscribers via the workstream settings.
